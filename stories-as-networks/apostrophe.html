    <h1>THE APOSTROPHE</h1>
    <p clas="body">One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the <span class="apostrophe"></span> for possession. Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case <span class="apostrophe"></span> has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like the <span class="apostrophe"></span> and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in.
