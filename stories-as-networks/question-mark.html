    <h1>THE QUESTION MARK</h1>
    <p class="body">The <mark></mark> is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a <span class=question></span> you ask a <span class=question></span> but anybody who can read at all knows when a <span class=question></span> is a <span class=question></span> as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the <mark></mark> Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. A <span class=question></span> is a <span class=question></span>, anybody can know that a <span class=question></span> is a <span class=question></span> and so why add to it the <mark></mark> when it is already there when the <span class=question></span> is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself to use a <mark></mark> I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. </p>
